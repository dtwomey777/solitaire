# Due date -- It was actually due at noon today so we'll be submitting late
I'm kind of confused about this. In the specs he says that for all virtual groups, the project is due by noon,
but canvas says 11:59 pm 

# Solitaire Project
This is the GitHub page for the Solitaire Project for AP Computer Science A.
In this repository is the main Java file. 
If you wish to make edits to it, please branch it off and make a pull request! 
I (Declan) am still learning more and more about GitHub (and Git in general), so it may be rough a bit. 
I have also created a Projects tab, so we can track our workflow a little bit better and see what we need to focus on more. 
We have until Tuesday to work on this, so we need to get to work.
